## Introduction
This microapp serves the page that users see when they access http://guestcenter.opentable.com/postlogin (or from similar subdomains like connect)

Only users with access to more than one RID will ever see this page.

In the future, users with access to one more more groups will also see this page.

## Getting Started
Follow standard Microapp procedures on main [Monorepo readme](https://github.com/opentable/gc-monorepo-admin/blob/master/README.md#1-run-this-apps-dev-server) — *EXCEPT* instead of `yarn task start` use `yarn start`.

Note: After running `yarn start`, PostLogin page will open, but first time you'll need to login at http://localhost:9000/login beforehand to get the page to load correctly. (This is also covered in [Monorepo readme](http://localhost:9000/login), but it's easy to miss)

To run all local unit tests:

```
yarn test
```

To update the test snapshots

```
yarn test --u

yarn test src/myfile.test.tsx
