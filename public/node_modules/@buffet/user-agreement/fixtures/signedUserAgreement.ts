          '<h1>POS Integration Addendum</h1> <p>This POS Integration Addendum (this “Addendum) is entered into by and between the client identified in Exhibit A (“Client”) and OpenTable, Inc. (“OpenTable”) as of the Effective Date specified below, and is attached to and forms a part of the Agreement (as defined below).</p><ol> <li> <p>Introduction. The parties previously entered into the OpenTable Guest Center Agreement identified on Exhibit A (“Agreement”), which governs use of the OpenTable System. Under this Addendum, as further described in Exhibit A, Client may access and use OpenTable’s point-of-sale integration for Guest Center (“POS Integration”). Under this Addendum, Client instructs OpenTable to access Client’s point-of-sale system and related software (“POS”) in order to retrieve and use certain data (as further described in Section 3 below) as part of the POS Integration. Use of the POS Integration is governed by the Agreement as modified by this Addendum, as further described in Section 10 (General). For clarity, the POS Integration shall be considered a function of the OpenTable System.</p></li><li> <p>Client Cooperation. In connection with the POS Integration, Client will provide reasonable assistance and cooperation to OpenTable and comply with its obligations set forth in Exhibit A and OpenTable’s reasonable instructions. Without limiting the foregoing, Client will (i) provide the name of an individual to serve as a point of contact for OpenTable and an email address for such individual, (ii) respond and cooperate with OpenTable to resolve issues arising from the POS Integration within 24 hours of request by OpenTable, and (iii) permit access to the POS by OpenTable personnel, including subcontractors, to enable the POS Integration.</p></li><li> <p>Data. The POS Integration will enable OpenTable to retrieve certain data from Client’s POS, such as restaurant information, menu information, table information, ticket information and related details (e.g. ticket items, check type, tender type, discounts, and payment information), revenue center, and employee details. To the extent not consisting of OpenTable Data, such data is considered “Client Data” under the Agreement (including without limitation for purposes of Section 4 (Client’s Obligations) of the Agreement), as modified by this Addendum. OpenTable may use such Client Data for its lawful business purposes, and any data export or download provisions in the Agreement do not apply for such Client Data.</p></li><li> <p>Reports. If specified in Exhibit A, as part of the POS Integration, OpenTable may provide Client with certain reports based on the data retrieved from Client’s POS under Section 3 (“Reports”).</p></li><li> <p>Use of Plugins. If specified in Exhibit A or otherwise by OpenTable, the POS Integration may include Third Party Plugins. Subject to this Addendum, Client may run the Third Party Plugins on its POS solely to enable OpenTable’s conduct of the POS Integration and for no other purpose. As required by the provider of the Third Party Plugins, Client agrees not to (and will not permit anyone else to): (i) copy, rent, lease, sell, transfer, assign, sublicense, disassemble, reverse engineer or decompile (except to the limited extent such restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of the Third Party Plugins, or (ii) otherwise use the Third Party Plugins on behalf of any third party. The Third Party Plugins may contain Open Source Software, in which case Section 13.10 (Third-Party Code) of the Agreement will apply. OpenTable and its licensors reserve all right and title (including intellectual property rights) in and to the POS Integration, including any Third Party Plugins. Except as set forth in this Addendum, the POS Integration is considered part of the “OpenTable System” under the Agreement.</p></li><li> <p>Client Representations. Client represents and warrants that (i) it has all necessary rights, consents, permissions and licenses to permit OpenTable to access the POS, to provide any data and to share any Reports or data as contemplated herein;</p><p>(ii) its entering into this Addendum and its use of the POS Integration will not violate any third party contract or agreement by which it is bound or any laws, regulations, rules or standards applicable to Client and (iii) Client shall not use any OpenTable Data provided to Client hereunder to send marketing communications to Users who have not consented to receive marketing communications from Client.</p></li><li> <p>Disclaimers. The POS Integration and all Reports are provided “AS IS”, fully subject to all disclaimers of warranty in the Agreement, and participation in POS Integration is at Client’s sole risk. CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (A) THE POS INTEGRATION AND REPORTS MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS AND OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COULD CAUSE SYSTEM FAILURES, DATA LOSS OR OTHER PROBLEMS; (B) OPENTABLE HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE TRAINING, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE OR ERROR CORRECTIONS FOR THE POS INTEGRATION OR REPORTS; (C) OPENTABLE HAS NO WARRANTY OR INDEMNITY OBLIGATION FOR THE POS INTEGRATION OR REPORTS OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS ADDENDUM; AND (D) OPENTABLE DOES NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE POS INTEGRATION OR REPORTS WILL MEET CLIENT’S EXPECTATIONS OR THAT USE THEREOF WILL BE SECURE OR ENSURE CLIENT’S COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS.</p></li><li> <p>Limitations of Liability. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OPENTABLE BE LIABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ADDENDUM OR THE POS INTEGRATION (A) FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE OR (B) IN ANY EVENT, FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100). In no event will OpenTable have any liability for Third Party Plugins. Client acknowledges and agrees that this Section 8reflects a reasonable allocation of risk and that OpenTable would not enter into this Addendum without these liability limitations.</p></li><li> <p>Term and Termination. This Addendum will commence on the Effective Date and continue until the termination of the Agreement, unless earlier terminated as set forth herein. OpenTable may terminate this Addendum for no reason or any reason at any time upon notice to Client, provided termination of this Addendum will not result in termination of the Agreement. Upon any termination or expiration of this Addendum or the Agreement, Client will cease using and delete (or permit OpenTable to delete) any software or other materials provided as part of the POS Integration in Client’s possession (including any Third Party Plugins).</p></li><li> <p>General. Capitalized terms not defined in this Addendum have the meanings given to them in the Agreement. Except as expressly set forth herein, all activities under this Addendum remain governed by the Agreement, including without limitation Sections 4 (Client’s Obligations) and 5 (Indemnity by Client) of the Agreement (and Client’s indemnity obligations also include any breach or alleged breach of this Addendum by Client). This Addendum will control in event of a conflict with the Agreement relating to the subject matter of this Addendum.</p></li></ol>',
