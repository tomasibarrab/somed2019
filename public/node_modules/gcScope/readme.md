# GcScope Utilities

This shared modules provides a set of utilities for managing gcScope from within
a microapp.

`gcScope` is a data object embedded in the main html file of each microapp and
containing information about the context for the app.

For example, you can see something like the following:

```
window.gcScope = {"id":"993457","type":"restaurant"}
```

in a small script tag placed in the `header` of the index.html file of a Guest Center microapp.

## Available utilities.

Retrieve the gcScope object within the given context. Typically used on the windows
object.

```ts
getGcScope(obj: any): GcScope
```

```ts
getScopeType(obj: any): ScopeType
```

Where:

```ts
type ScopeType = 'restaurant' | 'group' | 'none';

export interface GcScope {
  type: ScopeType;
  id?: number | string;
};
```
