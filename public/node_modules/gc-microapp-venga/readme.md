# User Accounts

## Introduction

This micro-app is capable of working under multiple contexts: Restaurant or Group.

The UI adapts depending on the context and allows to manage user accounts and access types (roles) for Restaurants and for Groups.

When developing you want to run the app locally under Restaurant type context or a Group type context.

## Run the App within Restaurant context

First run `gc-microsite-profile` on your machine and then run the microapp

```
yarn start:rid
```

The open your browser on `http://localhost:3000/admin/user-accounts/<groupid>/directory`.

The app will call the appropriate APIs on the microsite while the `dev-server` will proxy all other calls to pre-prod.

## Run the App within Group context

First to run `gc-microsite-group-setting` on your machine and then run the microapp

```
yarn start:group
```

The open your browser on `http://localhost:3000/group-settings/user-accounts/<groupid>/directory`.

As with the microsite-profile the app will call the appropriate APIs on the microsite while the `dev-server` will proxy all other calls to pre-prod.
