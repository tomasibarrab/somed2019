 * An opinionated merge operation for working with redux state. Performs a deep merge of two objects A and B:
 * - Neither A nor B will be mutated, and the return will not retain pointers to either.
 * - Properties of B will overwite those of A.
 * - Arrays are treated as primitive values and will not be merged.
