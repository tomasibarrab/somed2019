    Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Not if I weaken first. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Talk about going nowhere fast. Your head is not an artifact! Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? I'll alert the crew. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone

    Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Besides, you look good in a dress. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. You enjoyed that. Computer, belay that order. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Your head is not an artifact! Travel time to the nearest starbase? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. They were just sucked into space. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately?

    Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Your head is not an artifact! I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.
